this project runs on opengl 4.6 and uses GLAD this is a download to the configuartion im using so not to take up too much space
https://glad.dav1d.de/#language=c&specification=gl&api=gl%3D4.6&api=gles1%3Dnone&api=gles2%3Dnone&api=glsc2%3Dnone&profile=compatibility&loader=on

once downloaded put the "glad.c" source file inside the main folder

**this file is shared in open source for education purpose only**

HOW TO USE:
controls: 
  W: forward
  A: turn left
  S: backwards
  D: turn right
  E: look up
  Q: look down
  
 (if you feel the render distance is too small you can modify the max amount of steps in the fragment shader)
 
 KNOWN BUGS:
  -terrible warping(still looking into it)

  -setting your window too large will make you look backwards(you should be fine unless you try to strech the window horizontaly **A LOT**)

  -edges are see through(no DDA)

 (if you find some more please tell me)
